 * Total Submissions: 2.7M
 * Testcase Example:  '2\n[[1,0]]'
 *
 * There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to
 * numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i]
 * = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take
 * course ai.
 *
 *
 * For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to
 * first take course 1.
 *
 *
 * Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 * To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 * To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you
 * should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= numCourses <= 2000
 * 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
 * prerequisites[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
 * All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.
