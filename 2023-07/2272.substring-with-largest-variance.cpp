 *
 * The variance of a string is defined as the largest difference between the
 * number of occurrences of any 2 characters present in the string. Note the
 * two characters may or may not be the same.
 *
 * Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters only, return the
 * largest variance possible among all substrings of s.
 *
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "aababbb"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * All possible variances along with their respective substrings are listed
 * below:
 * - Variance 0 for substrings "a", "aa", "ab", "abab", "aababb", "ba", "b",
 * "bb", and "bbb".
 * - Variance 1 for substrings "aab", "aba", "abb", "aabab", "ababb",
 * "aababbb", and "bab".
 * - Variance 2 for substrings "aaba", "ababbb", "abbb", and "babb".
 * - Variance 3 for substring "babbb".
 * Since the largest possible variance is 3, we return it.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "abcde"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * No letter occurs more than once in s, so the variance of every substring is
 * 0.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
 * s consists of lowercase English letters.
